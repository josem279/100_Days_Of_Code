<h1>The Best Movies According to Jose</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time in no particular order.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>
  The entire Batman series is great but the second movie is the best in my
  opinion.
</p>
<h3>The Big Short</h3>
<p>
  Comedy meets finance in a retelling of one of the biggest disasters to occur
  in my lifetime.
</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Likely the best movie I've seen in IMAX to this day.</p>
